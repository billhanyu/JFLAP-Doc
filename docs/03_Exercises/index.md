Besides slideshows, another part of this project is exercise. Exercises allow students to really engage with the algorithms and gain knowledge in the process. Up until now, most demos have corresponding exercises that let students practice on their own. For example, `FATester` requires students to make a DFA using the editor so that it accepts strings specified by a regular expression or a description. For instructors' convenience, an exercise generator is also implemented, so that instructors can make their own exercises.
