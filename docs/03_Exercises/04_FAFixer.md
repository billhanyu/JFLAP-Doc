This is an exercise for student to fix an FA according to the problem statement.

Relative files:
`/fa/FA.js`
`/exerController/ExerciseController.js`
`/ui/FAEditor.js`
`/ui/FAFixer.html`

Similar to `FATester`, `FAEditor` reads the `id` of the `h1` tag in the html file and determins the file path based on that. `ExerciseController` handles the rest.

The page can be found in the [Demo](!Demo) section.
